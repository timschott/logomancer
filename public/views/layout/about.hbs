My name is <span class = 'special-name'>{{name}}</span>. I am a Software Engineer ... and an avid reader: yes, we exist!

I am fascinated by the effect of technology on language, especially with respect to the words we use and how we come to learn them. To view some my other work, head to my <a href = "https://timschott.com">personal portfolio website</a>.

This site is intended to display interesting words I find while reading fiction and non-fiction. Typically, if I find a fun word, I'll jot it on the inside cover of the book. But, before developing this site, I rarely did anything with the list when I finished reading. So these uncovered graphs go by the wayside. This site documents these terms and provides a space to sharpen my programming skills. Eventually, I hope to leverage my group of words in a digital project, perhaps exploring the rhetorical and narrative situations that writers employ choice words. Filtering and visualizations would be a logical next step as well.

This site was developed with <a href = "https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.JS</a> back-end and stores its data in a <a href ="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a> NoSQL database. The front-end code is templated in <a href ="https://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars</a>, and I used <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Boostrap</a> to decorate and design elements. The website is deployed on <a href="https://heroku.com">Heroku</a> with a (free!) TLS certificate from <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a>. Heroku poses a quick and simple alternative to a fully-loaded EC2 deploy, and I love the built in git hooks! My front-end work is published on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/logomancer">npm</a> The full repository for this project can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/timschott/logomancer">Github</a>. Definitions are from the <a href="https://www.oed.com">OED</a> whenever possible</a>.
